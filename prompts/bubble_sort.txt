Prompt 1: Simple Algorithm – Bubble Sort
Baseline:
“Write a Python function to perform bubble sort on a list of integers.”
Ambiguous:
“Sort this list in the usual way using Python. Make sure it's a basic sort method.”
Negated:
“Write a Python function that does not use built-in sort or sorted but still sorts the list.”
Contradictory:
“Sort this list using Python's built-in sort and without using sort at the same time.”
