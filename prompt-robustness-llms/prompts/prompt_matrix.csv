1,Baseline,Write a Python function to perform bubble sort on a list of integers.
1,Ambiguous,Sort this list in the usual way using Python. Make sure it's a basic sort method.
1,Negated,Write a Python function that does not use built-in sort or sorted but still sorts the list.
1,Contradictory,Sort this list using Python's built-in sort and without using sort at the same time.
2,Baseline,"Write a Python function to validate a username and password. Use regex to ensure password is at least 8 characters, contains a number and a special character."
2,Ambiguous,Check if username and password are valid using Python. Use good practice.
2,Negated,Write a function that validates credentials but doesn't use regex.
2,Contradictory,Validate the password using regex but avoid using regex in the implementation.
3,Baseline,Write a Python function to read a text file and print each line one by one.
3,Ambiguous,Can you get the contents of a file and print it line by line?
3,Negated,Write code to read from a file but do not use Python's open() function.
3,Contradictory,Read a file using the open() method without using it directly.
4,Baseline,Write Python unit tests using unittest for a function that calculates factorial of a number.
4,Ambiguous,Test a Python function that does math on a number.
4,Negated,Test the factorial function but don't use the unittest module.
4,Contradictory,Write unit tests using unittest but avoid using assertions.
5,Baseline,Create a Python class BankAccount that allows deposit and withdrawal. Handle overdraft errors using exceptions.
