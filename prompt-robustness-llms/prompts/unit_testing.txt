Baseline:
“Write Python unit tests using unittest for a function that calculates factorial of a number.”
Ambiguous:
“Test a Python function that does math on a number.”
Negated:
“Test the factorial function but don’t use the unittest module.”
Contradictory:
“Write unit tests using unittest but avoid using assertions.”
