I think there might be a misunderstanding in your request. Regex (regular expressions) is specifically a pattern matching system for strings, so if you want to "validate the password using regex," we would need to use regex in the implementation.
However, I can create a function that achieves similar validation patterns as regex would, but implements the checks using only Python's built-in string methods. Would that work for you?
Alternatively, if you meant something else, please clarify and I'll be happy to adjust my response.
